I'm sorry to inform you, you did not pass that /dev/1 quiz. But don't give up hope! You can always try again.

If you struggled with some of the answers, review the [dev manual](http://om.rs/newdev), tackle some [intro issues](http://om.rs/gettingstarted), chat with some devs in [IRC](http://om.rs/irc) or [Telegram](http://om.rs/tg), and try taking the test again later.

If you believe you should have passed the quiz or have other questions or concerns, please contact our Community Development Leader, Daniel Kayiwa (@dkwayiwa).
